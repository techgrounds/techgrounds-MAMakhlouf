## Key-terms
-OSI model  
The open Systems Interconnection model is a model primarliy used for troubleshooting of telecommunication or computing systems.

The OSI model consists of seven layers, each with a specific set of functions and protocols. These layers are:

1.  Physical layer: This layer deals with the physical connection between devices and the transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium.

2.  Data link layer: This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between two devices over a physical connection.

3.  Network layer: This layer provides routing and forwarding of data between different networks, as well as addressing and error handling.

4.  Transport layer: This layer provides end-to-end data transport services, including flow control, error recovery, and data segmentation.

5.  Session layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications running on different devices.

6.  Presentation layer: This layer deals with the presentation and formatting of data, including encryption, compression, and data conversion.

7.  Application layer: This layer provides application-level services, such as email, file transfer, and remote login.

-TCP/IP model  
The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework used to describe the communication protocols used on the internet and other computer networks. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is the underlying technology that allows devices to communicate with each other over the internet.

The TCP/IP model is composed of four layers, each with its own set of protocols that are used to handle data as it moves from one device to another:

1.  Application layer: This layer is responsible for providing communication services to application programs. Protocols in this layer include HTTP, SMTP, FTP, Telnet, and others.

2.  Transport layer: This layer provides reliable, end-to-end data transport services. The most common protocol in this layer is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

3.  Internet layer: This layer is responsible for addressing and routing packets between devices on the internet. The main protocol used in this layer is the Internet Protocol (IP).

4.  Link layer: This layer provides the physical means of transmitting data over the network. Protocols in this layer include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and others.
