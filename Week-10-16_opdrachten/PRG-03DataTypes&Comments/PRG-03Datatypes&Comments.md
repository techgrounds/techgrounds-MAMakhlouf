## Key-terms


## Opdracht
Exercise 1:  
● Create a new script.  
● Copy the code below into your script.  
a = &#39;int&#39;  
b = 7  
c = False  
d = &quot;18.5&quot;  
● Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.  
● Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.  

● Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.  

Exercise 2:  
● Create a new script.  
● Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.  
● Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
